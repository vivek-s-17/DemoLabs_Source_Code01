Below shown code represents the code I have currently in place in my ASP.NET Web API project being built using .NET 10 with SQL:

----------------------------------------------------------
GlobalUsings.cs
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
Program.cs
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
/Models/Category.cs
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
/Models/Product.cs
----------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------

Ensure that:
(a) For the EF Models:
    (1) Validate if the two models I have defined are correct.  
    (2) Ensure that the commented CREATE TABLE scripts and the models are in sync with each eachother.  
    (3) Add needed Indexes are defined.
    (4) Add Check Constraints and Unique Constraints where needed.
    (5) Feel free to make any needed changes to the EF Data Model(s), or add any other required Models.  
    (6) Add a scenario where I can use a STORED PROCEDURE.  For example, to show a report listing categories-wise number of products.
    (7) And, add a scenario where I can also use a VIEW, also.
(b) Proper DTO Models are defined, to perform the CRUD operations
(c) Avoid overposting is avoided
(d) Errors are reported, like
	(1) In the POST operation, CategoryId should not be received, since it is a DB generated Identity column
	(2) CategoryName is not duplicate (in both ADD and EDIT operations)
	(3) The DataAnnotation validators are respected
	(4) Duplicates are identified and ConflictExceptions are thrown
	(5) The POST operation only provides the URL to GET the newly inserted object along with 201 response
	(6) The PUT operation returns "Accepted" or "Rejected" along with the error messages from validation.
	(7) Use "RFC 7807 Problem Details" to report errors from the API - "ProblemDetails" and "ValidationProblemDetails" for exceptions, like NotFound errors, ValidationExceptions, etc.
	(8) Use Result Pattern instead of throwing Exceptions from Services to the API Layer.  
(e) Provide in-line comments wherever needed.
(f) Provide XML Comments for all the members.
(g) Add centralized structured logging
(h) Provide the response assuming the role of an Extremely Senior and Seasoned professional developer, and generate gold-standard code.
(i) Use RECORD CLASS or RECORD STRUCT where found most suitable.
(j) Implement Authentication and Authorization
    (1) Roles - Admin and User
    (2) JWT based Authentication and Authorization between API and Angular
    (3) Use ASP.NET Identity Management System, if possible for Roles, Users and Permissions
(k) Implement Centralized Structured Logging use Serilog.  
    (1) Sink to SQL for Cetralized Logging
    (2) Sink to SEQ for viewing 
    (3) Sink to Console for viewing


I would like to use this project to help learn and understand how to:
(a) develop a WEB API application
(b) use EF for Code-First Migration driven Development process
(c) Test the API endpoints using xUNit
(d) Consume the API endpoints using the latest Angular (version 22)

I would be using Visual Studio 2026 to do the development.

I wish to start by generating the code for the WEB API Project.   
But then, before that, it would help if you could begin with providing me an extremely detailed step-by-step development process, so that I can also learn how to check-in the code into GITHUB time-to-time.
